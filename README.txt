2. How to compile and run your program: Open the fold in Intellij to run the FractalDrawer file and choose a shape from a Triangle, Rectangle, and Circle and it will draw different shapes. 
3. Assumptions: 
If you type “Circle”, it will create four circles every time and each of these four circles will generate four circles at a time, and so on. This loop runs 8 times in my code. The area and the perimeter of the new circle will be half of the previous one. The four circles that were created by the previous one will be in four corners of the circle (although the circle has no corner).
If you type “Triangle”, it will create three triangles every time and each of these will generate three triangles at a time, and so on. This loop runs 8 times in my code. The area and the perimeter of the new triangle will be half of the previous one. The three triangles that were created by the previous one will be in the three corners of the triangle.
If you type “Rectangle”, it will create four rectangles every time and each of these will generate itself four rectangles at a time, and so on. This loop runs 8 times in my code. The area and the perimeter of the new rectangle will be half of the previous one. The four rectangles that were created by the previous one will be in the four corners of the rectangle.
4. Known bugs: I don’t know why the graphics in the canvas on my computer look a little strange but if you want to click on the top right corner and expand the page, you will see the correct graphic.
5. outside sources: use google to find how to write some comments.
6. Include the statement:
